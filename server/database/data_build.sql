    (2, 'Green energy', 'I will switch my electricity and gas supply to a green energy tariff', 782, 'https://ibb.co/QfKW9dh', 'The energy used to heat our homes, cook our food and power our appliances accounts for approximately 30% of the average persons carbon footprint. A green tariff means that the electricity you buy is matched by purchases of renewable energy that your energy supplier makes on your behalf, significantly reducing the emissions you create.

For households that rely on gas for heating and cooking, many clean energy providers offset the carbon emissions associated with any continued gas provision.
', 'In the UK, our electricity comes from a range of sources (see the breakdown of the last 24 hours [link: https://windeurope.org/about-wind/daily-wind/electricity-mix?utf8=%E2%9C%93&areas=GB&commit=Apply+filters]). 

In 2018 one third (33%) of the UK’s electricity came from renewable sources, up from 29.7% in 2017. Only around 3% of our electricity comes from coal today – compared to around 30% ten years ago. Despite these significant improvements, around 80% of the worlds energy is still generated from burning fossil fuels.

When you switch to a green energy provider, it does not mean that all your electricity then comes from renewable sources. There is no unused capacity in renewable energy facilities in the UK, so the energy you consume may still be generated by burning fossil fuels. However, good green energy providers ensure that for every unit of energy you use, a unit is produced and put on the grid by a renewable source. This helps compensate your emissions and drives the industry towards renewable energy.
